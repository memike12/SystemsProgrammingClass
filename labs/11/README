Task 1: myhost
I zeroed the hints and then said that I only want IPv4.
Then I did getaddrinfo for the argument provided. 
I then iritated through the linked list and printed ever IP address 
which matched the protocol TCP. 

Task 2: mywget

I print out batman but also print out HTTP/1.1 200 OK which makes the
extra credit fail. If I comment that out then I can't get the outputs
OK code 200 to pass.
