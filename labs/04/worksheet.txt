Task 1: Memory Leaks

    
    1. Run valgrind on the memleak program, how many bytes does it
       say have been definitely lost?
       60 bytes.
    2. What line does valgrind indicate the memory leak has occurred?
       33, 19, 49
    3. Describe the memory leak.
       The program memory leaks from calloc
    4. Try and fix the memory leak and verify your fix with
       valgrind. Describe how you fixed the memory leak.
       I freed a before it was reassigned by the function and then
       freed it again after

Task 2: Memory Violations

  1. Describe the output and exeuction of the program. Does it seem to be consistent?
     It outputs Hello World! The program makes an array and then
     copies it and outputs the copy. 
  2. Run the program under valgrind, identify the line of code that is
     causing the memory violation and its input.
     Copying hello to str is causing the memory violation.
  3. Debug the memory violation and describe the programming bug.
     I found that the NULL turminator wasn't copied when the program
     was copied.
  4. Fix the memory violation and verify your fix with valgrind.
     I added one to the size and then made sure it copied
     the terminator.

Task 3: Segfaults

  1. Reviewing the program =segfault.c=. Describe the expected output.
     It saves in three pairs, prints them, delets one, prints them,
     then deletes all the pairs.
  2. Compile and execute the program (don't forget the -g compilation
     flag). Use gdb to identify the segfault.
     the seg fault happens at line 52 during the pringf.
  3. Fix the segfault, and continue to the debug the program until
     the desired output is reached:
     I put an if statement in to make sure that the data wasn't null
     effectivly fixing the seg fault

Task 4: simplefs
     I got rm to work but it then my ls seg faults. I spent probably
     two hours on that then just gave up. as long as I only removed
     the last file then ls worked so I was happy that I got that
     far. I am pretty sure all the other programs work mostly how they
     should.
