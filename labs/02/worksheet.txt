For each of the tasks, describ your script logic, any issue you had,

Task 1:
     I cut the file at the first : in the etc/passwd file

Task 2:
     I took in the arguement and grep'd for that username. I then
     printed out the acutal name by cutting to the aproprate field.

Task 3: 
     I did an if statement checking if there was an argument, then if
     the file existed. if it didn't or there was no argument then an
     error was printed out to stderr. if it was a good file it ls -l'd
     the file and cut out the size then printed it out.

Task 4: 
     I started with my if statement to test if there was an arguement
     which resulted in an error if there wasnt. Then I made a for loop
     for all the arguements and printed out an error if the filename
     didn't exist. If it did exist then I had it print out the
     filename then size.

Task 5: 
     I checked if the required arguments were there, printed out an
     error if they weren't. I took the size from the arguments and
     saved it. I found the size of the file in question and saved
     it. Then I did a comparison to see which one was bigger and
     printed out the response according to that.

Task 6: 
     I figured out which exit codes go with which errors then I made a
     loop to find the args that were entered and check if the files
     were bigger than the number entered. This called isbiggerthan.sh
     to do it and isbiggerthanall.sh used its error code to determine
     if it was a good run.
