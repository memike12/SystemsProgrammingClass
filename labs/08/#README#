Task 1: unroll
     



Task 2: pipe-dup

     if you are in the child you want to test to see which part of the
     command line you are in. There are three options which are either
     the beginning, the middle, or the end which will be signified by
     a NULL following the argument. This same system is used for
     identifying the parts of the arguments in the parent as well. In
     the beginning of the argument in the child you want to close the
     read end of the pipe then close standard out then duplicate the
     pipe to standard out. if its the middle argument you close the
     output of the last pipe, close the stdout then duplicate the
     lastpipe to stdin. you close the current pipe input then
     duplicate the current pipe to stdout. The last test for the child
     is the last command line argument and you close the last pipe
     output, slose stdin then duplicate the input of last pipe to
     stdin. finally you exec the pipeline and then exit. 
     
     In the parent for the first argument you set the last pipe to be
     the same as the current pipe. the second argument closes the last
     pipe output and then copies the current pipe into the last
     pipe. otherwise at the end you close the output of the last pipe.
