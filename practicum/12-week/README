Prob 1: 

Prob 2:
     I couldn't get the piping to actually pipe through. I drew out
     what I wanted and implomented it but the middle child broken in
     half confuses me and I'm pretty sure that is where my error is. 

Prob 3:
     I can't figure out how to actually recieve the signal, or if I
     am, I don't really know what to do with it. The signal gets used
     on pong and it clearly shouldn't.
