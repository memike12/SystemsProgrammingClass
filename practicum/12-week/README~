Prob 1:
     I couldn't get the make file to work becasue there is no cugh
     file or directory for rpn. I have no idea why it is saying that. 

Prob 2:
     I couldn't get the piping to actually pipe through. I drew out
     what I wanted and implomented it but the middle child broken in
     half confuses me and I'm pretty sure that is where my error is. 

Prob 3:
     I can't figure out how to actually recieve the signal, or if I
     am, I don't really know what to do with it. The signal gets used
     on pong and it clearly shouldn't.
