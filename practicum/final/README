Prob 1: shell
I copied the file and added execute with chmod +x.
I added #!/bin/bash to the head of script.sh and then at the end I
echoed secret. 
I then executed the script.sh and piped it to base64 with the -d flag
to decode the message.
The message is HANG IN THERE and its some kind of werid animal thats
hanging on to something.

Prob 2: pipes
In the child I closed c to p's read then p to c's right. it executed
then i closed both pipes read and write. in the parent I closed p to
c's read, let it do its work then closed both pipes read and write.

Prob 3: sockets
I opened my proxy socket and bound that to my proxy information. thats
as far as I got and it also didn't work right.

Prob 4: threads
     I set xargs n to 5000 threads and then said I want the
     transactions to start at what ever incriment of 5000 i am
     on. then I said to create the thread using execute and giving it
     the xargs struct as an argument. my exectue then locks the mutex
     and then changes the balance for what ever that transaction
     amount is.
